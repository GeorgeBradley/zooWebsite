            <p>Amazing day at the zoo! Fantastic enclosures and it was really lovely to see the animals in such lovely enclosures and so much room for them to move, they are clearly well lookked after. Lots of lovely play areas all around the zoo, all lovely and clean and tidy. We saw lots of animals we hadn't see before including the bears. Bird show was wonderful, lots of facts that were appropriate for children. Fabulous place highly recommend. </p>

                "This was our first visit but will definitely not be our last! Great day out with a wide range of animals to see. A real plus in
                my opinion was that all the enclosures all seem a good size for the animals with lots to keep them entertained etc the
                lions and bears were worth the visit alone, you could spend as long as you wanted here various places to eat and drink,
                lots of play areas for the children and a maze. The bird show was worth watching however a must is the talk the
                elephant keeper did really informative and you also got to see these amazing animals a lot closer. If your looking for
                something to do then visit here."

    <h1>Kevin Smith</h1>
    This is by far the best zoo / have ever visited. The animals have space and freedom and their enclosures
    are immaculate. The talks were informative and staff friendly and welcoming. Really fun day out! The
    facilities are clean and well looked after with a lovely cafe and little gift shop. I would highly recommend.
